# RDP Shortpath for Azure Virtual Desktop

Connections to Azure Virtual Desktop use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RDP Shortpath is a feature of Azure Virtual Desktop that establishes a direct UDP-based transport between a supported Windows Remote Desktop client and session host. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by default uses a TCP-based reverse connect transport as it provides the best compatibility with various networking configurations and has a high success rate for establishing RDP connections. However, if RDP Shortpath can be used instead, this UDP-based transport offers better connection reliability and more consistent latency.

RDP Shortpath can be used in two ways:

- **Managed networks**, where direct connectivity is established between the client and the session host when using a private connection, such as a virtual private network (VPN).

- **Public networks**, where direct connectivity is established between the client and the session host through a NAT gateway, provided as part of the Azure Desktop service, when using a public connection.

The transport used for RDP Shortpath is based on the [Universal Rate Control Protocol (URCP)](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/urcp-universal-rate-control-protocol-for-real-time-communication-applications/). URCP enhances UDP with active monitoring of the network conditions and provides fair and full link utilization. URCP operates at low delay and loss levels as needed.

## Key benefits

Using RDP Shortpath has the following key benefits:

- Using URCP to enhance UDP achieves the best performance by dynamically learning network parameters and providing the protocol with a rate control mechanism.
- The removal of extra relay points reduces round-trip time, which improves connection reliability and user experience with latency-sensitive applications and input methods.
- In addition, for managed networks:
  - RDP Shortpath brings support for configuring Quality of Service (QoS) priority for RDP connections through Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marks.
  - The RDP Shortpath transport allows limiting outbound network traffic by specifying a throttle rate for each session.

## How RDP Shortpath works

To learn how RDP Shortpath works for managed networks and public networks, select each of the following tabs.

# [Managed networks](#tab/managed-networks)

You can achieve the direct line of sight connectivity required to use RDP Shortpath with managed networks using the following methods. Having direct line of sight connectivity means that the client can connect directly to the session host without being blocked by firewalls.

- [ExpressRoute private peering](../expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings.md)
- Site-to-site or Point-to-site VPN (IPsec), such as [Azure VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md)

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're using other VPN types to connect to Azure, we recommend using a UDP-based VPN. While most TCP-based VPN solutions support nested UDP, they add inherited overhead of TCP congestion control, which slows down RDP performance.

To use RDP Shortpath for managed networks, you must enable a UDP listener on your session hosts. By default, port **3390** is used, although you can use a different port.

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of the RDP Shortpath network connection:

### Connection sequence

All connections begin by establishing a TCP-based [reverse connect transport](network-connectivity.md) over the Azure Virtual Desktop Gateway. Then, the client and session host establish the initial RDP transport, and start exchanging their capabilities. These capabilities are negotiated using the following process:

1. The session host sends the list of its IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to the client.

1. The client starts the background thread to establish a parallel UDP-based transport directly to one of the session host's IP addresses.

1. While the client is probing the provided IP addresses, it continues to establish the initial connection over the reverse connect transport to ensure there's no delay in the user connection.

1. If the client has a direct connection to the session host, the client establishes a secure TLS connection.

1. After establishing the RDP Shortpath transport, all Dynamic Virtual Channels (DVCs), including remote graphics, input, and device redirection, are moved to the new transport. However, if a firewall or network topology prevents the client from establishing direct UDP connectivity, RDP continues with a reverse connect transport.

If your users have both RDP Shortpath for managed network and public networks available to them, then the first algorithm found will be used. Whichever connection gets established first is what the user will use for that session.

# [Public networks](#tab/public-networks)

When connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop using a public network, RDP Shortpath uses a standardized set of methods for traversal of NAT gateways. As a result, user sessions directly establish a UDP flow between the client and session host. More specifically, RDP Shortpath uses Simple Traversal Underneath NAT (STUN) protocol to discover the external IP address of the NAT router. 

Each RDP session uses a dynamically assigned UDP port from an ephemeral port range (49152â€“65535 by default) that accepts the RDP Shortpath traffic. You can also use a smaller, predictable port range. For more information, see [Limit the port range used by clients for public networks](configure-rdp-shortpath-limit-ports-public-networks.md).

There are four primary components used to establish the RDP Shortpath data flow for public networks:

- Remote Desktop client

- Session host

- Azure Virtual Desktop Gateway

- Azure Virtual Desktop STUN Server

> [!TIP]
> RDP Shortpath for public networks will work automatically without any additional configuration, providing networks and firewalls allow the traffic through and RDP transport settings in the Windows operating system for session hosts and clients are using their default values.

### Network Address Translation and firewalls

Most Azure Virtual Desktop clients run on computers on the private network. Internet access is provided through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway device. Therefore, the NAT gateway modifies all network requests from the private network and destined to the Internet. Such modification intends to share a single public IP address across all of the computers on the private network.

Because of IP packet modification, the recipient of the traffic will see the public IP address of the NAT gateway instead of the actual sender. When traffic comes back to the NAT gateway, it will take care to forward it to the intended recipient without the sender's knowledge. In most scenarios, the devices hidden behind such a NAT aren't aware translation is happening and don't know the network address of the NAT gateway.

NAT is applicable to the Azure Virtual Networks where all session hosts reside. When a session host tries to reach the network address on the Internet, the NAT Gateway (either your own or default provided by Azure), or Azure Load Balancer performs the address translation. For more information about various types of Source Network Address Translation, see [Use Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).

Most networks typically include firewalls that inspect traffic and block it based on rules. Most customers configure their firewalls to prevent incoming connections (that is, unsolicited packets from the Internet sent without a request). Firewalls employ different techniques to track data flow to distinguish between solicited and unsolicited traffic. In the context of TCP, the firewall tracks SYN and ACK packets, and the process is straightforward. UDP firewalls usually use heuristics based on packet addresses to associate traffic with UDP flows and allow or block it.

There are many different NAT implementations available. In most cases, NAT gateway and firewall are the functions of the same physical or virtual device.

### Connection sequence

All connections begin by establishing a TCP-based [reverse connect transport](network-connectivity.md) over the Azure Virtual Desktop Gateway. Then, the client and session host establish the initial RDP transport, and start exchanging their capabilities. If RDP Shortpath for public networks is enabled on the session host, the session host then initiates a process called *candidate gathering*:

1. The session host enumerates all network interfaces assigned to a session host, including virtual interfaces like VPN and Teredo.

1. The Windows service *Remote Desktop Services* (TermService) allocates UDP sockets on each interface and stores the *IP:Port* pair in the candidate table as a *local candidate*.

1. The Remote Desktop Services service uses each UDP socket allocated in the previous step to try reaching the Azure Virtual Desktop STUN Server on the public internet. Communication is done by sending a small UDP packet to port **3478**.

1. If the packet reaches the STUN server, the STUN server responds with the public IP (specified by you or provided by Azure) and port. This information is stored in the candidate table as a *reflexive candidate*.

1. After the session host gathers all the candidates, the session host uses the established reverse connect transport to pass the candidate list to the client.

1. When the client receives the list of candidates from the session host, the client also performs candidate gathering on its side. Then the client sends its candidate list to the session host.

1. After the session host and client exchange their candidate lists, both parties attempt to connect with each other using all the gathered candidates. This connection attempt is simultaneous on both sides. Many NAT gateways are configured to allow the incoming traffic to the socket as soon as the outbound data transfer initializes it. This behavior of NAT gateways is the reason the simultaneous connection is essential.

1. After the initial packet exchange, the client and session host may establish one or many data flows. From these data flows, RDP chooses the fastest network path. The client then establishes a secure TLS connection with the session host and initiates RDP Shortpath transport.

1. After RDP establishes the RDP Shortpath transport, all Dynamic Virtual Channels (DVCs), including remote graphics, input, and device redirection move to the new transport.

If your users have both RDP Shortpath for managed network and public networks available to them, then the first algorithm found will be used. Whichever connection gets established first is what the user will use for that session.

The diagram below gives a high-level overview of the network connections used by Azure Virtual Desktop with RDP Shortpath for public networks and Azure AD-joined virtual machines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using a TCP-based transport, outbound traffic from session host to client is through the Azure Virtual Desktop Gateway. With RDP Shortpath, outbound traffic is established directly between session host and client over the internet. This removes a hop which improves latency and end user experience. However, due to the changes in data flow between session host and client where the Gateway is no longer used, there will be standard [Azure egress network charges](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) billed in addition per subscription for the internet bandwidth consumed. To learn more about estimating the bandwidth used by RDP, see [RDP bandwidth requirements](rdp-bandwidth.md).

### Network configuration

To support RDP Shortpath for public networks, you typically don't need any particular configuration. The session host and client will automatically discover the direct data flow if it's possible in your network configuration. However, every environment is unique, and some network configurations may negatively affect the rate of success of the direct connection. Follow the recommendations below to increase the probability of a direct data flow.

As RDP Shortpath uses UDP to establish a data flow, if a firewall on your network blocks UDP traffic, RDP Shortpath will fail and the connection will fall back to TCP-based reverse connect transport. Azure Virtual Desktop uses STUN servers provided by Azure Communication Services and Microsoft Teams. By the nature of the feature, outbound connectivity from the session hosts to the client is required. Unfortunately, you can't predict where your users are located in most cases. Therefore, we recommend allowing outbound UDP connectivity from your session hosts to the internet. To reduce the number of ports required, you can [limit the port range used by clients](configure-rdp-shortpath-limit-ports-public-networks.md) for the UDP flow. Use the following tables for reference when configuring firewalls for RDP Shortpath.

If your users are in a scenario where RDP Shortpath for both managed network and public networks is available to them, then the first algorithm found will be used. Whichever connection gets established first is what the user will use for that session.

> [!NOTE]
> RDP Shortpath doesn't support Symmetric NAT, which is the mapping of a single private source *IP:Port* to a unique public destination *IP:Port*. This is because RDP Shortpath needs to reuse the same external port (or NAT binding) used in the initial connection.Â Where multiple paths are used, for example a highly available firewall pair, external port reuse cannot be guaranteed. Azure Firewall and Azure NAT Gateway use Symmetric NAT. For more information about NAT with Azure virtual networks, see [Source Network Address Translation with virtual networks](../virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource.md#source-network-address-translation).

### Teredo support

While not required for RDP Shortpath, Teredo adds extra NAT traversal candidates and increases the chance of the successful RDP Shortpath connection in IPv4-only networks. To learn how to enable Teredo on session hosts and clients, see [Teredo support](configure-rdp-shortpath.md#teredo-support).

### UPnP support

To improve the chances of a direct connection, on the side of the Remote Desktop client, RDP Shortpath may use [UPnP](/windows/win32/upnp/universal-plug-and-play-start-page) to configure a port mapping on the NAT router. UPnP is a standard technology used by various applications, such as Xbox, Delivery Optimization, and Teredo. UPnP is generally available on routers typically found on a home network. UPnP is enabled by default on most home routers and access points, but is often disabled on corporate networking.

### General recommendations

Here are some general recommendations when using RDP Shortpath for public networks:

- Avoid using force tunneling configurations if your users access Azure Virtual Desktop over the Internet.
- Make sure you aren't using double NAT or Carrier-Grade-NAT (CGN) configurations.
- Recommend to your users that they don't disable UPnP on their home routers.
- Avoid using cloud packet-inspection Services.
- Avoid using TCP-based VPN solutions.
- Enable IPv6 connectivity or Teredo.

## Connection security

RDP Shortpath extends RDP multi-transport capabilities. It doesn't replace the reverse connect transport but complements it. Initial session brokering is managed through the Azure Virtual Desktop service and the reverse connect transport. All connection attempts are ignored unless they match the reverse connect session first. RDP Shortpath is established after authentication, and if successfully established, the reverse connect transport is dropped and all traffic flows over the RDP Shortpath.

The port used for each RDP session depends on whether RDP Shortpath is being used for managed networks or public networks:

- **Managed networks**: only the specified UDP port (**3390** by default) will be used for incoming RDP Shortpath traffic.

- **Public networks**: each RDP session uses a dynamically assigned UDP port from an ephemeral port range (49152â€“65535 by default) that accepts the RDP Shortpath traffic. You can also use a smaller, predictable port range. For more information, see [Limit the port range used by clients for public networks](configure-rdp-shortpath-limit-ports-public-networks.md).

RDP Shortpath uses a TLS connection between the client and the session host using the session host's certificates. By default, the certificate used for RDP encryption is self-generated by the operating system during the deployment. RDP Shortpath uses a TLS connection between the client and the session host using the session host's certificates. By default, the certificate used for RDP encryption is self-generated by the operating system during the deployment. You can also deploy centrally managed certificates issued by an enterprise certification authority. For more information about certificate configurations, see [Remote Desktop listener certificate configurations](/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-listener-certificate-configurations).

> [!NOTE]
> The security offered by RDP Shortpath is the same as that offered by reverse connect transport.
